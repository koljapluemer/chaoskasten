Stop treating it like one. It's a physical thing that happens to your body. It's your body saying \"something is wrong, fix it.\" Symptoms of stress/anxiety include things that can be measured by doctors, such as weight gain, lack of sleep, blood pressure issues, acne, hair loss, etc. Many people try to treat stress as a feeling, and do things to make them feel better, like yoga, workout, have sex, go to the gun range, or buy little stress balls that they squeeze when they feel stressed. This is the incorrect way to deal with stress.\r\n\r\nThink of stress as financial stress. What is financial stress? You have too much to pay for and not enough money. If you were financially stressed and I told you I could make you feel better about it by selling you a squeeze ball for 20 bucks, would you fall for that garbage? I hope not.\r\n\r\nThis is how stress stacks up on your life: Imagine a graph. There is an invisible line somewhere on it going straight, horizontally, all the way across. That is your personal \"stress threshold\". Literally everything that you have to do in your life is a stressor. Imagine them as blocks stacking up on top of each other. Some are bigger than others. The closer you get to your threshold, the more stressed you feel. If you do not prevent them from crossing that threshold, you will enter depression, which is your body saying \"screw it, you won't fix it, I'll just shut everything down until it works itself out.\", much like how if you're freezing to death in the woods your body starts shutting down to save the vital organs, but you will still eventually freeze to death anyways. Think of stress as you shivering when it's cold, and depression as your body shutting down to preserve vital organs.\r\n\r\nSo, this is THE way to manage stress: You manage it. The pilot giving the training said to make a list, either mentally or literally, of EVERYTHING that stresses you out. Next, look at the list and see what you can actually take care of right then and there, and start knocking things off the list. You will literally be removing stress from your life. You ever wonder why people say they feel like their \"load is lighter\" or \"weight has been lifted off their shoulders\" after they complete a task? Because it has. Ever wonder why people say they feel good after mowing the lawn, or going to the gym, or whatever? It's because they've actually removed a stress block from their life. They've done something. Often times, people try to manage stress by drinking tea, or doing yoga, or doing things that simulate to their mind that they're accomplishing something, when really they're just tricking their brain into releasing the chemical that it does when you actually get something done. The REAL way is to actually identify the things that stress you out, and REMOVE them from your pile of stressors.\r\n\r\nWhen you make your list, literally write out everything. Pretty much if you think about something and say \"Oh crap, I have to do that.\", it's a stressor. Everything from brushing your teeth in the morning, to changing that light bulb in the laundry room, to gassing up your car, to studying for that test, to out-processing for that deployment, to going to that job interview, etc etc. Write them down, look at it, and think \"Oh shoot, I could just change that lightbulb right now. I could mow the lawn. I could fix that door hinge.\" Do this and you will be on your way to becoming more productive and less stressed. I've been doing this for years now and it works GREAT. It's how these fighter pilots manage their personal lives and flying a stupid fast war machine in combat. There have been a few times where I did still get too stressed out, but it was because I literally just had too much on my plate that was beyond my control, but since I understood how stress works, I was able to still get ahold of it and break myself out of the slight depression I had slipped into.\r\n\r\nFURTHER NOTES:\r\n\r\nTypes of stress:\r\n\r\n-Residual Stress (AKA Emotional Baggage): This type of stress cannot be eliminated, or is VERY difficult to remove. It is things that have happened to you in the past that you drag with you forever. They feel like things you need to \"fix\", but since they're locked in the past, you can't do anything about them, so they cause your stress pile to start out a little higher no matter what you do. You fell on your face that one time at school, or your parents never loved you, or you got stage fright that one time, etc etc. Some people have more than others, and it just always eats at the back of your mind. I have found an awesome way to get over this, but it is using my interpretation of the \"heathen worldview\", which is another tip for another time.\r\n\r\n-Reoccurring Stress: These are things that pop up on a reoccurring basis, such as daily chores, bills, house or work maintenance, etc. They are usually small stressors for people, but since they pop up often, they're always needing to be removed anyways. People often shrug these off, but they can sneak up on you. If you don't take care of the small things, the big things will stack higher, faster. Ever heard the phrase \"the straw that broke the camel's back\"? That straw was probably a Reoccurring Stressor.\r\n\r\n-Time Sensitive Stress: These are stressors that are hanging over your head but cannot be taken care of yet. Your college finals. Job interviews. Upcoming vacation. Etc. They are among the hardest for me to deal with, because they are there, but you can't do them yet. The way to reduce their impact is to ensure you are knocking out the easier stress blocks in the meantime. Change that lightbulb, get your car serviced, mail that package, etc. Another way is to recognize the precursors to that Time Sensitive Stressor, like studying for the college finals, or preparing for the job interview. You will still be knocking things out, being productive, removing stress, and will be better prepared for the TSS when it does arrive.\r\n\r\nA note on Depression:\r\n\r\nThis part of the training has to basically alienate a specific group of people. If you are clinically depressed, then this method may not help you manage your depression because your brain works differently. Depression is where you haven't removed enough stress blocks and so your body says \"screw it\". The danger here is that it will remove your energy, motiviation, etc. By understanding this, you will be able to get back in the saddle, remove some stressors, and get your life back under control. The pilot/instructor went deeply into the phases of depression, and what is known as a \"psychotic break\". Depending on where you are in your depression when you hit your psychotic break, you will lash out in a certain way. Example: if you're in \"inner\", you will hurt/kill yourself. If you're in \"outer\", you will hurt/kill someone else. But what makes it a \"psychotic break\" is that is will be completely bizarre. The example he used was Brittney Spears shaving her head vs. the NASA officer who went to Florida to kidnap her boyfriend's lover. Brittney Spears had much less stress on her life, yet she flew through all the stages of depression and basically hit her psychotic break at a point that caused her to just completely snap and shave her head. The NASA officer underwent a TREMENDOUSLY stressful entire life before finally lashing out at a person who made little to no impact on her overall life. It basically demonstrated how much some people can mentally endure compared to others, and how failure to manage it can cause serious problems.\r\n\r\nA story of my usage of this training:\r\n\r\nI'll make it quick. I was a SSGt in USAF. I was in college full time also. I had orders to the desert. I was a crew lead at my base for my specific job. I had finals for college coming up. In that same week, I had WAPS testing, which is how USAF enlisted troops test for rank. It's a big deal. I ALSO had to out-process for my deployment that week (anyone in can attest to what a stupid pain in the ass that can be). I was super stressed and it got to be too much. But I understood how stress worked. I couldn't make my finals come sooner, nor my WAPS test. Out-processing could be done during work hours. But I still had to lead my crew, which entailed all kinds of bullcrap. So here's what I did. First thing first, I told another NCO on my crew \"Listen man, you're an NCO, you know the ropes, you're the crew lead now.\" I literally just dumped part of my plate onto his, but he was trained/qualified/capable of doing it, and that's literally what he was there for was to lead the crew if I wasn't around. So I just made him the primary and I took the alternate slot. A huge stressor gone. Next, I ensured all my little stuff was taken care of, such as chores/ honey-do's around the house. After that, I made sure I had a dedicated time for WAPS and college studying, so that that stressor didn't bleed into my thoughts all the time. Finally, I made out-processing my primary concern during the work day, so no work-related stressors could pile up. All I had to do was make appointments and knock things off a checklist. This literally saved me from becoming overwhelmed and let me make it through the ordeal. When it was all said and done I did great on my college finals, I didn't make rank (that's OK though, the cutoff score was high for my career that year), and I got to the desert (and back) in one piece. Thanks random fighter pilot on instructor TDY!\r\n\r\nAnyways, I hope this helps someone. It has gotten me through a lot, and I share it whenever I can. Take care everyone!\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Don't think of stress as a feeling. Treat it like financial stress. Think of stress as physical blocks stacking up on your life.

It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.\r\n\r\n> Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important organs never vary, for these same authors practically rank that character as important (as some few naturalists have honestly confessed) which does not vary; and, under this point of view, no instance of any important part varying will ever be found: but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can be given.\r\n\r\n> These differences blend into each other in an insensible series, and a series impresses the mind with the idea of an actual passage.\r\n\r\n*such elegance:*\r\n> The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for mere convenience sake.\r\n\r\n> All that we want to show is that where many species of a genus have been formed, on an average many are still forming, and this holds good.\r\n\r\n>And thus, the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into groups subordinate to groups.\r\n\r\n> Hence, if certain insectivorous birds (whose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey) were to increase in Paraguay, the flies would decrease\u2014then cattle and horses would become feral, and this would certainly greatly alter (as indeed I have observed in parts of South America) the vegetation:\r\n\r\n> The store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at first sight to have no sort of relation to other plants.

the growth of the young seedling,\r\n\r\n> special means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection, as the mane to the lion,\r\n\r\n> In the same way that a knife which has to cut all

Bundling +\r\n\r\n    Combine two input vectors in single output vector which *is similar* to both input vectors; also called **Superposition of Vectors**.\r\n\r\n    Example:  \r\n    H =  name_v \u2297 Alice_v + birth_v \u2297 1980\r\n\r\n    In this case multiple information which is already binded is bundled together via +, alias superpositioned. We can get specific information by binding with its vector, e.g. searching for the name:\r\n\r\n    name_v \u2297 H = name_v (name_v \u2297 Alice_v + birth_v \u2297 1980)  \r\n    = name_v \u2297 name_v \u2297 Alice_v + name_v \u2297 birth_v \u2297 1980  \r\n    = Alice_v + *noise*\r\n\r\n    This noise can easily be  eliminated by searching for its nearest neighbor which most likely is going to be the vector ALice_v.\r\n\r\n3. Permutation (or Protect) \u03a0\r\n\r\n    Protect vectors if double binded: Prevent Mixing roles and fillers.\r\n\r\n    Example:  \r\n    (A \u2297 X) \u2297 (B \u2297 Y) !Associative and commutative, therefore mixing, better:  \r\n    (A \u2297 X) \u2297 \u03a0(B \u2297 Y)\r\n\r\n    This operator is typically implemented as permutation of vector dimensions.\r\n\r\n### Application to Robotic Tasks\r\n\r\n1. Encoding Real World Data\r\n    * run images through existing CNN for image descriptors and take output from third layer (~70.000 dimensions)\r\n    * locality sensitive hashing to reduce: normal vector from above hyperplanes, then normalized; therefore range from [-1,1] -> multiply-add-permute architectur (see above)\r\n\r\n2. Bundling Views for Object Recognition  \r\n    * task: recognise object from multiple angles\r\n    * bundle multiple view into one vector; therefore a new view only has to be compared against this single vector\r\n\r\n3. Sequence Processing for Place Recognition  \r\n    * task: place recognition with given sequence of previous visited places\r\n    * take image vector as in (2.)\r\n    * replace each in sequence with a bundle of itself an +/- number  of images before and after it\r\n    * each image is bound to static position vector to preserve order of images\r\n    * new sequences can now pairwise compaired with the previous sequence vectors\r\n\r\n    Frage: Ist es nicht insgesamt eher zeitlich gebunden denn Feature?\r\n\r\n3. Learning and Recall of Reactive Behavior  \r\n    * task: learn simple reactive behavior from demonstration (sensor-action-pairs)\r\n    * setup: differential drive robot with left and right distance sensor and central light sensor; goal: drive while avoiding obstacles until light source is found\r\n    * learning procedure: single vector with whole program by combining sensor's condition vector with actuator's result vector; then combine those to in one rule vector; then all rule vectors in one final program vector\r\n    * clean-up memory: actuator-value pair and result vector is stored to recall from noisy vectors\r\n\r\n#### Limitations, Discussions and Open Questions\r\n\r\n* lack of clear definition of VSAs: necessary to know their capabilities\r\n* encoding of real world data into vectors: requirements on properties of encoding/decoding is vital\r\n* connection to probabilistic methods needed\r\n* structured approach to design VSAs missed", "drawer": 208, "reference": [438,

likely requires brainlike architecture\"\r\n* brain: different hardware and internal code accomplish same computing; details of code established over time through interaction with the world\r\n* computer: code predefined; generalized understanding not inherent\r\n* therefore: not just copy brainlike architecture but rather **understand principles of its computing**\r\n\r\n### The von Neumann Architecture\r\n* data and instructions for its manipulation are of the same kind (in uniform memory)\r\n* main idea: not a different architecture but **different representation** (of entities which the com. works with) is needed\r\n* High-dimensional random vector with its mathematical properties and arithmetic operations\r\n\r\n### An Engineering View of Computing\r\n* representation: pattern in physical medium (i.e. binary)\r\n    * binary vectors via positional representation\r\n    * each bits position holds its meaning\r\n* systemized and mechanized manipulation of patterns by circuits\r\n* abstraction from neural realization to its mathematical representation necessary\r\n* rather high dimensional binary vectors in comparison to its represented number -> simple algorithm possible\r\n\r\n### Properties of Neural Representations\r\n\r\n* Hyperdimensionality\r\n* Robustness:\r\n    * redundant representation\r\n    * proportion of allowable errors increases with dimensionality\r\n* Independence from Position: Holistic Representations\r\n    * information encoded should be distributed ~equally over all components\r\n* Randomness:\r\n    * hardware and internal patterns differ due to learning and chance\r\n    * randomness therefore ensures compatible systems\r\n    * random hypervectors are used to begin with", "drawer": 208, "reference": [437, 328, 599,

It simply could not be done. Yikes.\r\n\r\nAnd if that wasn't enough for Lexus, a few early customers reported some minor, non-safety issues with their cruise control.\r\n\r\nAnd by \"a few\" customers, I mean... two. Not 2,000. Two.\r\n\r\nSo Lexus recalled Every. Single. Car.\r\n\r\nAnd by \"recall\", I mean that Toyota sent a driver with a replacement car to each and every owner for them to use while their own car was being driven back to the dealership and repaired, before being returned. Detailed, with a full tank of gas.\r\n\r\nAnd a small gift to apologize for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nFree of charge, of course.\r\n\r\nThat's how you truly make the automotive world stand up and take notice.", "drawer": 120, "reference": []}}, {"model": "zettelkasten.note", "pk": 1955, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "Tell me a joke", "content": "What do you call a French man wearing sandals?\r\n\r\nPhilippe Philoppe", "drawer": 120, "reference": [1956, 1957]}}, {"model": "zettelkasten.note", "pk": 1956, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "Tell me a joke", "content": "My friend keeps saying \u201cCheer up man, it could be worse.

And Germany\u2019s warmongering was getting scary - France had fallen, the USSR and USA were both neutral so far, and only Britain was left to stand against the nazis.\r\n\r\nAs he said years later, he believed he had to do something for the good of humanity. Even though, by all accounts, he was a nobody - just a hotel clerk and failed chicken farmer, who\u2019d briefly served on both sides of the spanish civil war, leaving with a dislike of Fascism and Communism both.\r\n\r\nSo Juan, naturally, decided to become a spy, and fuck over Hitler as hard as he could. Logical career move for a hotel clerk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree. But the british, who he wanted to help, weren\u2019t interested - he\u2019d asked to help at the embassy in madrid several times. The brits were all like \u201cwho are you? Actually never mind we don\u2019t care you can\u2019t do shit to help us and we don\u2019t really trust you, so scram.\u201d\r\n\r\nJuan, of course, was undeterred. He decided that the nazis had to be destroyed, and he figured if would be easier to do so from within. So he reinvents himself as a fanatically fascist government official and applies to \u201chelp\u201d the germans spy on the brits, claiming he has a way to actually get undercover to britain to spy on them. All of this is utter bullshit, of course.\r\n\r\nThe germans say \u201cuh sure we could use the help,\u201d and hire him. Since he can\u2019t get to britain, he goes to lisbon portugal, frequenting the library to learn about britain so he can convincingly just Make Shit Up. He sends the German navy on a wild goose chase for a nonexistent naval convoy at the Mediterranean island of Malta. The germans are convinced he\u2019s the best spy they have in britain. After all, the rest of them keep getting captured, except for the ones Garcia is recruiting. Or, rather, inventing. His recruits were as real as the maltese convoy, which is to say, not even a little real. They did make good fall guys to blame when his \u201cintel\u201d was off.\r\n\r\nThe brits meanwhile are looking for him, since the german codes they were breaking showed the germans allegedly had a spy setting up a spy ring in britain. But then they read his messages - Juan allegedly had a scottish contact who \u201cwould do anything for a litre of wine\u201d\r\n\r\nThat tipped the brits off that someone was just fucking with German intel. I mean, metric system, anyone? A scotsman who drinks WINE?! unrealistic.\r\n\r\nSo eventually the lisbon british embassy tipped off MI6 that this guy in lisbon was trying to tell them he was literally a german intelligence agent and would like to help fight the nazis please.\r\n\r\nSo they brought him to britain, and gave him the codename Agent Garbo. He teamed up with mI6 where he continued to bullshit the nazis with a combination of pure lies, true but useless intel, and useful intel that arrived just a bit too late to help the germans at all.\r\n\r\nHe convinced the germans D-Day was a feint, not the main allied invasion. That would come farther east at Calais, he convinced the germans. The First US Army Group led by General Patton would lead it.\r\n\r\nThe first US army group was made of divisions that didn\u2019t exist, in an empty base, with inflated fake tanks and airplanes to convince german planes flying above dover think it was legit.\r\n\r\nThe Germans kept a large number of troops and tank divisions back at calais, to repel an invasion force which never landed. These troops could have stopped the allied landings at Normandy. Instead they sat at Calais, doing nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Germans gave Pujol the Iron Cross 2nd class for his essential aid to the nazi regime. The British government soon after made him a Member of the Order of the British empire.\r\n\r\nHis German spy handler gave him his iron cross in person after the war, apologizing profusely for failing to win the war he\u2019d helped them so much with.\r\n\r\nI imagine it was difficult to keep a straight face for that conversation.", "drawer": 120, "reference": []}}, {"model": "zettelkasten.note", "pk": 1963, "fields": {"profile": 1330, "title": "Welcome", "content": "\nCreate a new note by clicking the `New Note` Button on one of the desks.\n\nWith an open note itself you can do the following:\n\n* `Pin:` Your note will be displayed in the \"Pinned\" section in the sidebar, allowing you quick access at any time\n* `Connect:` By clicking the *Connect* button, you can connect two notes with each other, creating references to each other on each note.

Make or find a low-poly 3D model of a car in any modeling software you like. Just make sure to export it as a .obj \r\n## 2\r\n2.) Import the .obj into Pepakura Download here and organize the unfolded 3d model onto paper to print. I recommend watching a few videos on how to use Pepakura to get the best results! \r\n## 3\r\n3.) Print the template onto cardstock. (Don\u2019t use regular paper! The results are gross!) Use an x-acto knife to cut out the pieces and score the edges with a ball-point pen. Glue the parts together with Elmer\u2019s glue. (Don\u2019t use superglue or epoxy etc. Those adhesives are too strong). Do not attach wheels/wings until they and the car body are painted. \r\n## 4\r\n4.) Paint the car. YOU MUST USE PRIMER!!! If you want a light color, use white primer. Darker colors require black primer for best results. If you want, put this Krylon Shimmer metallic paint over black primer for awesome metallic effects! You can find some here: Amazon Krylon paint \r\n## 5\r\n5.) Paint on accents/windows by using painter\u2019s tape to stencil out the rest of the car. Take this slowly. Don\u2019t try to paint everything at once or you might mess up in some spots. \r\n## 6\r\n6.) Attach wheels with hot glue. Do this diagonally so the car sits flat on the ground.

Maybe when the iLasercutter app comes to Android.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, start by making the piece on the left of OP's image, the tails. Don't make the thinnest part too thin, the angles too weird or the remains too close (which will make the other piece thins too thin). If you want it pretty much the same on both sides, cheat and clamp the boards together and cut them at the same time. For your first few tries, use same thickness wood and have the depth of the cut be the thickness of the wood.\r\n\r\nNow, clamp and saw to the cutline. The trick is to beat your brain into submission. It is going to be screaming, \"Cut square to the wood!\" but you want to cut to the angle of the line you drew. Don't worry if you're not perfect to your drawn line, it'll look planned fancy with the tails a little different.\r\n\r\nYou've sawn the tails, next step is to sharpen your chisels. This thread will still be here later; go spend a month of your life learning to sharpen your hand tools (humor, but no joke). Now that you have sharp chisels, get the widest chisel you have that is shorter than what you're cutting and use firm but gentle strokes to rive the cut line. Take your time, let the chisel know you're working, but you're cutting wood, not forming cold steel. Don't smack the whatever out of that poor chisel, it'll just get mad and bite you or the wood or both.\r\n\r\nNow we cheat a little. Get a coping saw and patiently remove most of the waste. Then get your chisel that you haven't used for anything else, especially not opening metal finish cans, and carefully chisel the little niblet of waste away. The key is patience. If you're not patient you're liable to become a patient.\r\n\r\nSo, these lines we just cut were drawn on the face grain. Now we take the piece we just cut and draw those lines onto the end grain of the other piece. We can't cut this part two at once. In fact, many drawers only have a dovetail for the front of the drawer because that is where the strength is needed. Especially in the summer after making the drawer fit a smidge snug in the winter.\r\n\r\nNow we want to keep the blade square to the flat of the (endgrain) wood, but cut the angle line we drew. We need turn on the part of our \"Cut square!\" brain we turned off before and turn off the other such part that has a cow for the angle we are cutting. Chisel a riven score, coping saw, chisel away nibs like before.\r\n\r\nHopefully every thing has gone well up to now. The initial fit. Ideally it doesn't fit. You want it to be a bit too tight so you can sand down to good fit. Be patient and sand to fit. Chiselling or sawing will lead to kindling.\r\n\r\nHow tight? If you're going to be gluing, you want it loose enough you can put it together and take it appart by hand without a soft mallet. If no glue but otherwise permanent, tight enough that you need to tap it into final place with a soft mallet - gentle taps, mind you. If it is going to be frequently assembled / dissassembled, you want to have to smack it together with your hands. (When you're in the field, feel free to be gentle with soft mallet to avoid pinching.\r\n\r\nYou're mixing end grain and face grain. The two types of grain will look different after finishing. This is as it should be. If any lout comments on a poor finish job because of this the only place they deserve wood is upside the head. It is probably a hard head, so use the edge of a double-wide LVL engineered lumber plank to minimize damage to wood.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt other will chime in too. I'm not the best at explaining things that I know how to do. The best is to see this done in person, but, well, COVID.\r\n\r\nGood luck!", "drawer": 120, "reference": [1462]}}, {"model": "zettelkasten.note", "pk": 2071, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "car: Ultima in the snow", "content": "<https://old.reddit.com/r/carporn/comments/iz248v/took_my_ultima_out_in_the_snow_did_some_skids/>", "drawer": 139, "reference": []}}, {"model": "zettelkasten.note", "pk": 2072, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "1972 Maserati Boomerang \u2013 Steering Wheel", "content": "<https://old.reddit.com/r/WeirdWheels/comments/iycli3/1972_maserati_boomerang_steering_wheel/>", "drawer": 111, "reference": []}}, {"model": "zettelkasten.note", "pk": 2073, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "Are we all moral criminals for making addictive systems?", "content": "<https://old.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/ixx4zz/are_we_all_moral_criminals_for_making_addictive/>", "drawer": 111, "reference": []}}, {"model": "zettelkasten.note", "pk": 2074, "fields": {"profile": 2, "title": "Advanced Programming/Development Channels", "content": "Brackeys was so valuable in my Unity journey.
